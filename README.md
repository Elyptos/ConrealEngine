# ConrealEngine

A simple game engine for creating games with the Windows command prompt.
Included is a sample game for showing the usage of the engine.

## Important notice

This project was developed because of curiosity. As such I will not actively
maintain it and I cannot guarantee that it will be suitable for production.

## Installation
This project was made for Windows with Visual Studio. Solution files are included
within the repository.

You can also download Windows binaries from the release page.

The sample project contains enemy sprites. The goblin sprite was altered by me
and is based on this sprite sheet:

*https://opengameart.org/content/lpc-goblin by Stephen "Redshrike" Challener and William.Thompsonj*

The orc and troll sprites are also custom made iterations of the goblin sprite sheet.
